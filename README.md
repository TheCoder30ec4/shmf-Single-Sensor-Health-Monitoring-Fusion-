  <p>This project explores a novel approach to fall detection and movement tracking using a <span class="bold">single sensor</span> and LSTM modeling. Our goal is to develop <span class="bold">cost-effective</span> and <span class="bold">efficient</span> systems for healthcare applications.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Utilizes a single sensor to capture <span class="bold">multi-dimensional movements</span>.</li>
    <li>Leverages LSTM models for accurate sensor value prediction (<span class="bold">78% accuracy!</span>).</li>
    <li>Custom-built sensor with ESP32 and BNO055 for seamless data transmission.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This project demonstrates the potential of LSTM models and single-sensor solutions for <span class="bold">improved healthcare monitoring</span>. By streamlining sensor networks, we can create <span class="bold">more efficient fall detection and movement tracking systems</span>.</p>
